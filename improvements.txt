add a kill button on top level to stop program execution
using configuration-save buttons (calculate) are clicked,
    provide an indication, e.g., change button color briefly for save duration
changing the coil currents, change them all w/ same value (except +- signs),
    single one is reset by deleting/re-adding it
adding a new row (in calculate), use the same values as in the previous line
saving the 3D trajectory (plot), capture the 3 V's, and coil current

single particle, or multiparticles, multithreaded parallelized w/ ipython?
    does importing multiprocessing or threading help? try it?
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/parallel-processing-in-python/
doesnt seem to plot second particle on 3D graph
release Tkinter window during run
show a plot of delta_t during run, if selected as option in calculate panel
on the 3-D trajectory plot use default isometric angle perspectives to improve response
is there a way to indicate exit point in 3D
use bigger font size on windows (plot)

what happened to the total energy, or velocity magnitude plot diagnostics?
when adding a second particle use a different color map, maybe green to red?
