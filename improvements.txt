USER OPERATION
add a kill button on top level to stop program execution
release Tkinter window during run
using configuration-save buttons (in calculate mode),
     when clicked provide an indication, e.g., change button color briefly for save duration

CALCULATE WINDOW
changing the coil currents, change them all w/ same value (except +- signs),
    if a single one needs to change, reset it by deleting/or re-adding it
adding a new row (in calculate), use the same values as in the previous line
saving the 3D trajectory (plot), capture the 3 V's, and coil current

PLOTTING
generally seems too slow for active user interaction
use bigger font size on windows (plot)
single particle, or multiparticles, multithreaded parallelized w/ ipython?
    does importing multiprocessing or threading help? try it?
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/parallel-processing-in-python/
doesn't seem to plot second particle on 3D graph
on the 3-D trajectory plot, provide default isometric angle perspectives
    this is to improve response
diagnostic for a plot of delta_t during run, if selected as option in calculate panel
is there a way to better indicate the particle exit point in 3D?
with multiple particles, is it possible to use different color maps, maybe green to red?

ACCURACY/ERRORS
what happened to the plot diagnostics for total energy, or velocity magnitude?
