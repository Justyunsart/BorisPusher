DOCUMENTATION
still need a roadmap that documents the code, esp. all the sub-scripts
    maybe try using AI as a first step?

USER INTERFACE/OPERATION
display the absolute path for the input files used in the calculation

sometimes, when creating the directory for the output files, the number of steps indicated in the filename is not the same
    as shown in the TK window


include an option for square-shaped (non-circular) B-coils

CALCULATE WINDOW
The washer potential option - displays "Diameter" and "inner_r"
    - please use "Outer Dia" and "Inner Dia"
The field diagnostic plots are no longer available
adding a new line/or row in fields, use values identical to the preceding line

PLOTTING
file called "coils" in the output data directory, what is it for?

haven't implemented multiple particles yet,
    are different color maps possible, maybe green to red?
    does importing multiprocessing or threading help? try it?
    single particle, or multi-particles, multithreaded parallelized w/ ipython?

ACCURACY/ERRORS


FINISHED ITEMS??
add a kill button on top level to stop program execution
release Tkinter window during run
in the user home directory maybe use ~/user/PythonData/ for I/O data repository
The "Inputs" directory in Git should contain run-guaranteed settings
Another ~user/"Inputs" directory would take custom run settings
diagnostic for a plot of delta_t during run, if selected as option in calculate panel
The Diag Plots do not work
When changing the coil parameters, change them all w/ same value (except +- signs),
    if a single coil parameter needs to change, reset it by deleting/or re-adding it
on the 3-D trajectory plot, nice to provide several isometric angle perspectives
is there a way to better indicate where the particle exits in 3D, maybe provide coordinates?
what happened to the plot diagnostics for total energy, or velocity magnitude?
