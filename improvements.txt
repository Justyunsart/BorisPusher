document the code, esp. all the sub-scripts, try using AI first

USER INTERFACE/OPERATION
when the output directory is created, the number of steps indicated in the filename is not the same
    and sometimes seems to be 10x, or 100x, less than shown in the TK window

add in the new window (indicator) something to display the path and filenames used in the calculation
include a square-shaped coil option, perhaps with angled (isosceles; 45,45,90), or rounded, corners

CALCULATE WINDOW
The Diag Plots do not work
When changing the coil parameters, change them all w/ same value (except +- signs),
    if a single coil parameter needs to change, reset it by deleting/or re-adding it
when adding a new row (in calculate), use the identical values as in the immediately preceding line

PLOTTING
The Diag Plots do not work
In the outputs directory there is a new file called "coils".
    What is it for? Should have one for E-field/Potential params.

single particle, or multi-particles, multithreaded parallelized w/ ipython?
    does importing multiprocessing or threading help? try it?
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/parallel-processing-in-python/
on the 3-D trajectory plot, nice to provide several isometric angle perspectives
is there a way to better indicate where the particle exits in 3D, maybe provide coordinates?
haven't implemented multiple particles yet, but are different color maps possible, maybe green to red?

ACCURACY/ERRORS

what happened to the plot diagnostics for total energy, or velocity magnitude?
add a kill button on top level to stop program execution
release Tkinter window during run
in the user home directory maybe use ~/user/PythonData/ for I/O data repository
The "Inputs" directory in Git should contain run-guaranteed settings
Another ~user/"Inputs" directory would take custom run settings
diagnostic for a plot of delta_t during run, if selected as option in calculate panel
