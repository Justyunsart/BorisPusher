'''This script grabs header data from a preselected text file that was used in
 one of the  two Boris Push simulations. These data will be printed at the
 top of the output trajectory plot created by Plotly.
 For the moment these test files reside in
 the working directory, but will be modified to use the file names and paths
 in the companion diff.py script where the HDF5 data file is stored.
